# Encrypt-Decrypt1 
Description:

The next Python script implements the Caesar Cipher, an encryption technique for secure communication. It takes a string of text and a shift value as input and provides the encrypted or decrypted text as output.
The next Python script implements the Caesar Cipher, an encryption technique for secure communication. It takes a text string and shift value as input and provides the encrypted or decrypted text as output.

How it works:

Input text: The user is prompted to input a string of text they want to encrypt or decrypt.

Shift value: The user is prompted to enter a shift value. It's the number of positions each letter in the text will be moved.
Shift value: The user is prompted to enter a shift value. The number of positions for each letter in the text will be moved.

Direction: The user is prompted to enter the direction of the shift - "encrypt" or "decrypt." If "encrypt" is chosen, the shift will be to the right (forward in the alphabet). If "decrypt" is chosen, the shift will be to the left (backward in the alphabet).

Processing: The script processes all characters of the input text. A letter is shifted by the shift value in the specified direction. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
Processing: The script processes all characters of the input text. The shift value shifts a letter in the specified direction. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

Output: The script outputs the resulting string after all characters have been processed.
